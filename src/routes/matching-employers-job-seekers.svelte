			<p class="s">
				In 2019, TRR mostly helped employers during redundancies and recruiting candidates. But TRR
				realized they could extend their offering to employers by improving their current digital
				offerings. Therefore, my team was formed with the goal to identify these opportunities and
				execute on them.

				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>
					Working as the sole UX Designer in a team of developers and a product manager we created a
					search tool for recruiters to find qualified and competent staff. I had a leading role and
					facilitated the design process with the team. I did extensive user research, prototypes,
					UI and user tests.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2 class="m" id="Talk-to-employers">Part I: Talk to employers üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>
			<p>
				I started with the basics: research. In the first months of the project, I interviewed 20+
				representatives of the employers side to, based on these interviews created 5 <a
					href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/persona/">personas</a
				>
				to describe users' needs, goals, attitudes and behavior patterns.
			</p>
			<p>
				From my research, we understood that there was a lot of room for improvement to bring more
				value to employers. Now we needed to find the one thing that would have the biggest impact
				on TRR's business. For us, that meant narrowing our focus down to HR managers at
				medium-to-large companies.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a next step, I facilitated a series of workshops to delve deeply into the desires and
				needs of our primary persona. I facilitated <a
					href="https://www.inuse.se/read/many-faces-impact-mapping/">Impact Mapping</a
				> sessions to define our wanted effects and what we could do, with the main question being: how
				might we support their goals?

			<h2 class="m" id="Explore-ideas">Part II: Explore ideas üí°</h2>

			<p>
				At this point, the Product Manager decided to address our primary persona's need to find and
				hire qualified employees. To explore what we could to solve the problem, I facilitated a
				Remote <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Design Sprint.</a> I invited the developers in
				the team, the Product Manager and stakeholders in the organization who had insight about the
				challenge. We decided to use <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Miro</a> because we had participants
				from remote locations and wanted everyone to be able to contribute on equal terms.

			<h2 class="m">The winner</h2>

			<p>
				We voted and the idea that received the most votes was an idea about a recruitment tool for
				employers. The goal was to match employers' need for competencies with qualified candidates
				from the TRR's wide range of job-seekers. Leaving the design sprint, we had a tested
				prototype and a bunch of fresh hypotheses which we needed to evaluate further.
			</p>

			<div class="divider">
				<img src={srcDivider} alt="Divider svg" />
			</div>

			<h2 class="m" id="Refinements">Part III: Refinements ‚ôªÔ∏è</h2>
			<p>
				I revised the prototypes based on the feedback and included more refined ideas as we went. I
				continued to test the prototype with employers, who found it useful for recruiting
				competencies which are hard to find. HR managers saw a great benefit in getting in touch
				with candidates through TRR before they reached the official labor market. Recruitment
				agencies also found value in a unique access to potential candidates.
			</p>

			<p>
				We developed a first iteration of the service with only the most important features. We
				continued to refine the functionality in parallel with development. We wanted to know what
				features were the most important and how the service would fit in the user's daily work.
			</p>
			<p>
				The hypotheses was evaluated iteratively through user tests with prototypes and user
				interviews. From our research, we knew we needed to accomplish three things:
			</p>

			<ul class="margin">
				<li>
					Make employers able to find candidates with industry specific competencies. For example,
					programming languages or industry specific software.
				</li>
				<li>
					Make it possible for recruiters to quickly evaluate if the candidate is a good fit for the
					role and the company. Many recruiters also told us they wanted to review the career goals
					of the candidates before considering contacting them.
				</li>
				<li>
					Provide the search results at high speed, not keeping the user waiting when adding and
					removing search filters.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="m">Present the right candidates</h2>
			<p>
				A big challenge was to make sure the results of the search were perceived as relevant to
				recruiters. We needed to figure out if we should present candidates who fulfills:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All of the criterias.</li>
				<li>At least one criteria from each category.</li>
				<li>Any of the criterias.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We explored different solutions to this challenge and talked to our target users. From my
				research we got the insight about recruiters often have a perfect profile with all the
				competencies required in the job description. In reality, it's difficult to find candidates
				who checks all the boxes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Therefore we decided to separate the search results list in two, one with candidates who
				fulfilled all of the criterias and a second where we included the candidates who were
				missing some criterias. In the second one, the missing criterias were also highlighted to
				allow the user to quickly evaluate the profiles.

			<p>
				Although we had a first basic version of the service almost ready to be released, we hit
				some trouble. Instead of releasing it to employers right away, the management team postponed
				the launch. The reason was because the functionality for employers to sign in to TRR wasn't
				yet ready. A huge learning for me has been the importance of identifying all dependencies
				early on. Instead of releasing it right away to our target group, the management team
				decided to make it available as an internal tool. This was a set back for us, but I know
				that we did a lot of good work, and are proud of what we achieved:
			</p>
			<ul class="margin">
				<li>
					A simle and smooth UI for searching for candidates. The user research showed that
					employers couldn‚Äôt wait to start using our service.
				</li>
				<li>
					A base of extensive user research to build upon. A huge part of the work I did was
					establishing a knowledge base for the organization to continue improving and identifying
					opportunities from.
				</li>
				<li>
					We were the first team at TRR to use the Design Sprint as a method to involve the
					stakeholders in the organization and solve problems together.
				</li>
				<li>
					Demonstrating the power of design where we showed the organization how to develop
					meaningful and valuable services using a user-centered approach.
				</li>
			</ul>
